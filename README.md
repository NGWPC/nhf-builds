Building Hydrofabric &amp; Processing Ancillary Data

<img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="docs/img/hydrofabric.png" alt="hydrofabric" width="40%" height="40%"/>

### Getting Started
This repo is managed through [UV](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) and can be installed through:
```sh
uv sync
```

### Development
To ensure that hydrofabric-builds follows the specified structure, be sure to install the local dev dependencies and run `uv run pre-commit install`

### Documentation
To build the user guide documentation for Icefabric locally, run the following commands:
```sh
uv sync --extra docs
uv run mkdocs serve -a localhost:8080
```
Docs will be spun up at localhost:8080/

#### Proposed Schema

The following schema is the proposed data model for NGWPC hydrofabric datasets produced by this repo.

##### Flowpaths FACT Table

The central table (or FACT Table) is `Flowpaths`. Each `flowpath` has a downstream, and upstream `nexus` point, allowing for traversal of a river network through a single table. Additionally, there is a 1:1 relationship between `flowpath` and `divide`.

##### NGEN Tables

The tables highlighted in green are the infomation needed for lumped modeling to take place. Lumped models require attributes, the shape of the `divide` that is being modeled, and a `nexus` point for flow to be aggregated to.

##### Routing Tables

The tables highlighted in blue contain the information needed for routing at a high resolution. T-Route is expected to run at a fine-scale (~300m segments) with many `virtual_flowpaths`. Each virtual flowpath is delineated based on the reference fabric, and there should be a many -> one relationship between `virtual_flowpaths` and `flowpaths`, with some `virtual flowpaths` not being represented in the `flowpaths` table. These non-represented `flowpaths` have the parameter of `routing_segment` set to False, and will have flow estimated through flow-scaling.

##### Reference Crosswalks

The NGWPC Hydrofabric is build using many reference materials:
- Reference Flowpaths
- Reference Reservoirs
- USGS/ENVCA/CADWR/TXDOT Streamflow Gages
- NHD+

To ensure `flowpaths` can be mapped to back to the materials that created them, each of the reference materials is mapped to `flowpaths`, `hydrolocations`, and `virtual flowpaths`. The following IDs pairings are used:

- Reference Flowpaths -> `ref_fp_id`
- Reference Reservoirs -> `dam_id`
- USGS/ENVCA/CADWR/TXDOT Streamflow Gages -> `site_no`
- NHD+ -> `nhd_feature_id`
